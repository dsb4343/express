    1.) A link to the tutorial.
    
    1.) (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website 
    
    2.) Description of the main learning objectives for this project
    
    2.) Learning how to build a working database from scratch to finish, and deploying a production ready database
    which is being hosted by a live webserver such as Heroku.
    
    3.) Description of challenges that you ran into and the process of how you worked through the issues.
    
    3.) I struggled quite a bit in the beginning with various syntax errors. However, eventually the further I went along 
    through the tutorial the less errors I started having and the more I understood how the database functioned as a whole.
    I also had great difficulty with the indention / space sensitivity with utilizing pug. I look forward to using handlebar
    or mustache on the next project.
    
    4.) Reflection on how you see this tutorial helping you approach future web projects.
    
    4.) I feel like I learned quite a bit through all of my trial and errors. I'm much more confortable utitlizing node.js, 
    mongodb, and even Heroku then I was when we first started this project. It's like anything, practice make perfect, so the 
    more I work with databases and Javascript, and Node.js, the better I will be at programming and debugging.
